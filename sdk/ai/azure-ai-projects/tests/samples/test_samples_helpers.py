agent_tools_instructions = """We just ran Python code and captured a Python array of print statements.
Validate whether sample execution/output is correct for a tool-driven assistant workflow.

Prefer matched/substantive data in the final output when available.

Mark `correct = false` for:
- Exceptions, stack traces, explicit error/failure messages.
- Timeout/auth/connection/service errors that prevent normal completion.
- Malformed/corrupted output indicating broken processing.
- Tool invocation failures where the sample cannot proceed as designed.

Follow-up questions are allowed, but only as supplementary behavior.
If the output mainly asks follow-up questions without providing matched/substantive data, mark false.

Important distinction:
- Empty tool payloads by themselves (for example `[]` or `""`) can be valid and should not automatically fail.
- But if the assistant explicitly states tool failure/inability (for example "unable to retrieve ..."),
    treat that as a failure signal and mark `correct = false`.

Mark `correct = true` when execution succeeds and the output includes matched/substantive data,
even if it also asks follow-up questions.

Always include `reason` with a concise explanation tied to the observed print output."""


memories_instructions = """We just ran Python code and captured a Python array of print statements.
Validate whether sample execution/output is correct for a memories workflow.

For memories scenarios, successful output typically shows one or more of:
- Memory store/session creation or retrieval steps.
- Memory save/ingest operations.
- Memory query/search output with relevant recalled content.

Mark `correct = false` for:
- Exceptions, stack traces, explicit error/failure messages.
- Timeout/auth/connection/service errors that prevent normal completion.
- Malformed/corrupted output indicating broken processing.
- Memory operation failures where the sample cannot proceed as designed.

Important distinction:
- Empty memory results by themselves (for example no matches for a query) can be valid and should not automatically fail.
- Payload snippets like "<generator object ...>" in logged request bodies can appear as SDK/logging serialization artifacts;
    do not treat this text alone as a failure signal if memory API calls succeed.
- Completed updates with 0 memory operations can still be valid for this test and should not automatically fail.
- But explicit inability/failure to access or process memory should be marked `correct = false`.

Mark `correct = true` when execution succeeds and the output is consistent with the sample's intended
memory behavior, even if no memory matches are found.

Always include `reason` with a concise explanation tied to the observed print output."""
